This mod includes several items for debris. It can be used in a particular scene that involves explosion, crashing or collapsing to building, window, road, ground or something else. 

The density, somewhat rotations and scales among the pieces of debris can be adjusted on Blend Shape tab of the adv. mode of HS2PE / AIPE. Please check the demonstration video for the relevant effects: https://youtu.be/KbJP4rwWEEE .

Please note that the item, Debris 2 and Debris 2 Transparent, which use specular shader might show dark unless there is a reflection probe in the scene or graphic settings.
